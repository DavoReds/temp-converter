= Temperature Converter

Simple CLI utility to convert temperature units between Celsius, Fahrenheit and
Kelvin. Can be used with either `f32` or `f64` types.

[IMPORTANT]
====
*If you want the library.*

This crate used to have both a binary and a library version, but now they've
separated into two different crates in a workspace. This way, you don't have to
import any of the CLI program's dependencies if you only want to convert units
yourself. You should instead point to
https://crates.io/crates/temp-converter-lib[temp-converter-lib]. Heads up, the
interface has been changed and might break your program.
